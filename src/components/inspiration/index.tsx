        “This mission was inspired by a great woman named Eva. She was a person
        dedicated to helping the Hispanic community. Eva and I began doing
        garage sales together out of my home. Sadly she died on April 1, 2015.
        After her death, my family experienced a difficult financial situation.
        My husband was left without work and we were raising four children. I
        searched for help in existing organizations but was unable to receive
        assistance. I realized that others were experiencing the same situation
        and I wanted to dom something. Now, when there is no place else to turn,
        they may come to Eva Mission.”
